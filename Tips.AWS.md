Some collected notes/tips re: AWS

* "most resources in AWS have to be globally unique"
* "there is no internal DNS for instance names"
* "metadata is immutable"
* "networks are regional and not global"
* "you can implement a post-install script to set the hostname locally and register it with route53"
